# codeLottery
This is real project that I've done working of freelance
The main concept was about making a page where user given with special code full fill a form with its personal data and plays a lottery.
Lottery was about chosing one of 9 cards with possibility to win some prizes
All ceredentials were previously removed for security reasons
Project was build by using pure PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/AJAX and PHPmailer lib for smtp emailing
